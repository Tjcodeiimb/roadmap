// Temporal motion blur, the way a film camera does it: a frame is the average of n renders spread
// across the shutter, centred on the frame's time. n comes from how fast things move on screen in
// that frame (scripts/measure-speed.py, optical flow on the sharp render), so fast moves smear
// instead of stamping copies and still frames render once.
//
// The averaging happens outside the browser (scripts/accumulate.py, in floating point, quantized
// once). Compositing the samples in Chromium quantizes every layer to 8 bits, which turns smooth
// gradients into contour rings, tints light greys and darkens the frame a little per sample.
